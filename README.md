## Use-of-artificial-intelligence-in-near-infrared-spectroscopy
This work has benefited from aid from the French State giving a favorable opinion from the government and which is part of a collaborative research initiative proposing to study the approaches relating to artificial intelligence, precisely that of the Deep Learning. It relies on a large dataset available online (https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/projects/lucas) and of which I would only study one part that will be necessary to achieve my goal which is to implement the Transfer Learning and testing its effectiveness in terms of performance, speed of convergence, and robustness.
